Remember:
  Premature optimisation is the root of all evil - Knuth
  Debugging is at least twice as difficult as programming.  So if you
  write a program that uses all of your ability, you'll never be able
  to debug it all.

[+] In progress

##### HIGH PRIORITY ##################################################

[X] Split up chanserv.c, operserv.c nickserv.c and multiserv.c into
    smaller files. 
    
[+] Catch up on commenting *ugh*. 

[ ] Implement the long awaited SET command in channel service.

[+] Split up GREP command. One for NickServ and one for ChanServ.

##### LOWER PRIORITY #################################################

[+] Make it possible to set noexpire on channels and nicknames.
    Currently only working for channels.

[ ] Make it possible via a setting from setup.h to decide whether
    recently dropped channels can be registered again instantly.

[ ] Have a look at operserv ACCESS command.

[+] Auto-op, if deopped due to net-join after net-split.
    Perhaps a function in OS to do a force-cycle on a channel.

[ ] nickserv_info: Status must be either active/expired or disabled.

[X] When unregging an expired or disabled channel -- don't make E
    leave the channel as it is not there.

##### IDEAS ##########################################################

[ ] Make a command in chanserv to reg a channel to services.
    ie. a possibility to reg official channels to a non-user nick,
    and automatically setting the channel no-expire, and adding
    the user issuing the command with level 499
