Syntax: NOEXPIRE <nickname> [ON|OFF]
    
This command is used to set/toggle the noexpire flags for
nicserv accounts. This can be used to prevent the automatic
removal of expired nick. If no second parameter is given or the
parameter is not a valid on/off indicator, the flag is toggled.
Note that accounts which have OPER ON is already marked as 
noexpire by the oper flag and noexpire does not alter this 
in any way.
