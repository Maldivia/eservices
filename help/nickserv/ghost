Syntax: GHOST <nickname> <password>
      
If you suddenly get disconnected from your isp or the irc server, 
sometimes a ghosted client will be left behind. This command can
be used to kill the ghosted client so you can get your registered
nickname back.
   
GHOST can also be used to recover a registered nickname if it's 
taken by another user who is not the rightful owner of the nickname.
