Syntax: GLINE <user@host|nick|channel> <duration> <reason>
   
GLINE issues a network wide ban on <user@host> lasting duration. For 
info about the format of duration, see HELP BAN in channel services.

If a <nick> is specified instead of a valid user@host, the hostname
for the specified nick is used (*@host).

If a <channel> is specified, all users in the specified channel (except
opers) are glined individually.
