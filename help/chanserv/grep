want to search the user database for email simply add the @ character
to your mask.
  
Examples:
  
GREP USER c*    - This will list all nicks starting with a c.
GREP USER c*@*  - This will list all nicks with an email starting 
                  with a c.

You can use the character '?' as a wildcard for exactly one 
character.
